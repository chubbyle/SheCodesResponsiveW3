        A **croissant** is a French pastry that is typically crescent-shaped,
        which is the origin of its French name¹. The first recipe for the
        croissant as it is known today emerged only as recently as 1906¹. The
        classic crescent-shaped French pastry is made from a yeast-based dough,
        which is rolled and layered to incorporate butter¹. Because of the cost
        of butter, many bakers use cheaper substitutes such as margarine¹. Most
        bakeries in France offer two types of croissants: croissant and
        croissant au beurre (“croissant with butter”)¹. The former tends to be
        more breadlike, whereas the latter is much richer and, predictably, more
        buttery¹.

        Golden, buttery croissants should be crisp and flaky on the outside and
        soft and tender on the inside, with a texture that can be almost pulled
        apart¹. Croissants are often stuffed with different sweet or savory
        fillings¹. The classic sweet-filled croissants use almonds, marzipan, or
        chocolate, whereas savory croissants might be filled variously with
        cheese, spinach, or ham¹. Croissants are a common part of a continental
        breakfast in many European countries and served as dessert all around
        the world².
